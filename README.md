# Chandrayaan-3-Spacecraft-Control
Welcome to the Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft Galactic Space Craft Control repository! Here, we address the captivating task of creating a program to manage communication and control for ISRO's Chandrayaan 3 lunar spacecraft. I've successfully coded this project, harnessing the power of AI tools and leveraging support from AI websites.



**objective**: 
The primary objective is to translate commands transmitted from Earth into executable instructions that the spacecraft can comprehend. The spacecraft's navigation is determined by galactic coordinates represented in the x, y, and z axes, where x denotes east or west, y signifies north or south, and z indicates the distance above or below the galactic plane.

Key Features:
- **Initial Configuration**: The program commences with the spacecraft's initial position (x, y, z) and its starting direction (N, S, E, W, Up, Down).
- **Command Interpretation**: We've implemented a robust command interpretation system that allows the spacecraft to perform various maneuvers based on the received character array of commands.
- **Forward/Backward Movement**: The spacecraft can move one step forward or backward, maintaining its current orientation.
- **Left/Right Rotation**: A 90-degree rotation to the left or right can be executed, causing the spacecraft's direction to shift accordingly.
- **Up/Down Angle Adjustment**: The spacecraft's angle can be modified, enabling it to rotate upward or downward.
- **Boundary Constraints**: The program ensures that all spacecraft movements and rotations remain within the galactic boundaries, preventing any unintended excursions.
- **Incremental Approach**: The development process is well-documented through an incremental approach, showcasing the evolution of the codebase in individual commits.
- **Modularization**: The codebase is structured in a modular fashion, promoting readability, maintainability, and ease of extension.
- **Efficiency and Accuracy**: Our program is designed to execute commands accurately and efficiently, enabling Chandrayaan 3 to navigate the cosmos seamlessly.
- **Clean Code Principles**: We adhere to clean coding practices, resulting in a codebase that is not only functional but also highly readable and understandable.
- **Commit History**: The repository maintains a clear and informative commit history, highlighting the step-by-step progression of the project.

Please join us on this exhilarating journey as we empower Chandrayaan 3 to traverse the vast expanses of the galaxy with precision and finesse. Your contributions, feedback, and collaboration are highly valued as we work towards enhancing our spacecraft control system.

Let's embark on this coding adventure and propel the boundaries of space exploration!
